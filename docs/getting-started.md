# Getting Started with LuxChat Hackathon

## Introduction

LuxChat is a chat application built on the Matrix protocol. This guide will help you get up to speed quickly.

## What is Matrix?

Matrix is an open standard for decentralized, real-time communication. It provides:

- **Decentralization**: No single point of control
- **Interoperability**: Connect different chat systems
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Secure by default
- **Open Standard**: Transparent specifications

## What is LuxChat?

LuxChat is a Matrix-based chat application that [add specific details about LuxChat here].

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- [ ] Basic understanding of chat protocols
- [ ] Familiarity with [programming language]
- [ ] Development environment set up (see [Development Setup](./development-setup.md))
- [ ] Access to Matrix test servers

## First Steps

1. **Understand the Matrix Protocol**
   - Read the [Matrix Protocol documentation](./matrix-protocol.md)
   - Explore the [Matrix Client-Server API](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/)

2. **Set Up Your Environment**
   - Follow the [Development Setup guide](./development-setup.md)
   - Configure your IDE/editor

3. **Explore LuxChat Architecture**
   - Review [LuxChat Architecture](./luxchat-architecture.md)
   - Understand the component structure

4. **Start Building**
   - Check [API References](./api-references.md) for implementation details
   - Use [Tools & Utilities](./tools-and-utilities.md) to speed up development

## Key Concepts

### Rooms
Matrix conversations happen in "rooms". Each room has:
- A unique ID
- Members (users who have joined)
- Events (messages, state changes, etc.)
- State (room name, topic, encryption settings, etc.)

### Events
Everything in Matrix is an event:
- Messages (`m.room.message`)
- Reactions (`m.reaction`)
- Read receipts (`m.receipt`)
- Typing notifications (`m.typing`)

### Homeservers
Users connect to a homeserver (like `matrix.org`), which:
- Stores account information
- Manages room membership
- Federates with other homeservers

## Next Steps

- [ ] Complete the [Development Setup](./development-setup.md)
- [ ] Review [Matrix Protocol basics](./matrix-protocol.md)
- [ ] Explore [API References](./api-references.md)
- [ ] Join the team communication channel
