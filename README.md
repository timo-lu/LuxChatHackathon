- Mandatory end-to-end encryption of messages;
- IT infrastructure hosted and operated in Luxembourg;
- Open communication between Luxchat service providers;
- No advertising in the Application;
- No monetization of user data.

Each service provider is free to provide a free or paid communication service for the general public and/or businesses, e.g. premium value-added service, with the aim of promoting innovation, creativity and the development of the ICT market.

Luxchat will provide the foundations for the development of new innovative services (free or paid) based on the trusted environment of the application and the national instant messaging ecosystem.
